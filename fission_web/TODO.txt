- static font to ensure unicode characters (triangle, check mark, etc.)?
- parcel hmr error in production build??
- apply user-select: none to disable text selection on buttons etc.
- the longest rod names cause buttons to get larger; either make font smaller or buttons larger to start with
- remove browser focus outline when using keyboard?
- is there any benefit in making lists of props for widgets in ToolBarLeft constructor as opposed to leaveing them in the render method? E.g. instead of rodDropdownItems being a list of keys, it could be a list of jsx elements.
- add hotkeys, tooltips
