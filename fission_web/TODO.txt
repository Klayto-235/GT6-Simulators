- static font to ensure unicode characters (triangle, check mark, etc.)?
- is there any benefit in making lists of props for widgets in ToolBarLeft constructor as opposed to leaveing them in the render method? E.g. instead of rodDropdownItems being a list of keys, it could be a list of jsx elements.

- enable repeat on hold for keyboard undo/redo (see https://github.com/greena13/react-hotkeys for documentation)
- scroll area offset wrong based on zoom (fix might require lifting scroll are implementation up)
